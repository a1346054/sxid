.TH SXID 1 "January 2002" "sXid @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
sxid \- check for changes in s[ug]id files and directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sxid
[ --config <file> ] [ --nomail ] [ --spotcheck ] [ --listall ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Sxid
checks for changes in suid and sgid files and directories based on its last
check. Logs are stored by default in /var/log/sxid.log.
The changes are then emailed to the address specified in the configuration
file. The default location for the config file is
.I @TMPCONF@/sxid.conf
but this can be overridden with the --config option and specifying an
alternate location.
.SH "OUTPUT"
The program outputs several different checks concerning the current status of
the suid and sgid files and directories on the system on which it was run. This
is a basic overview of the format.
 
In the add remove section, new files are preceded by a '+', old ones
are preceded by a '-' NOTE: that removed does not mean gone from the
filesystem, just that it is no longer sgid or suid.

Most of it is pretty easy to understand. On the sections that show
changes in the file's info (uid, gid, modes...) the format is
old->new. So if the old owner was 'mail' and it is now 'root' then it
shows it as mail->root.

The list of files in the checks is in the following format:

        /full/path              *user.group    MODE

(MODE is the 4 digit mode, as in 4755)

In the changes section, if the line is preceded by an 'i' then that
item has changed inodes since the last check (regardless of any
s[ug]id change), if there is an 'm' then the md5sum has changed.

If a user or group entry is preceded by a '*' then it's execution bit is
set (ie. *root.wheel is suid, root.*wheel is sgid, *root.*wheel is +s).

On the forbidden directories, if
.I ENFORCE
is enabled an 'r' will precede forbidden items that were succesfully -s'd,
and an '!' will show that it was unsuccesfully -s'd (for what ever
reason).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c, --config <file>\fR
specifies an alternate configuration file
.TP
\fB\-n, --nomail\fR
sends output to stdout instead of emailing, useful for spot checks
.TP
